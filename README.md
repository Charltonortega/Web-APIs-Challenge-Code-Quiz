## References

This project was greatly influenced and inspired by several resources. Below are detailed descriptions of these resources and the extent of their influence:

1. **[YouTube Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4fB9Xg2JEY&t=2996s)**: This step-by-step tutorial by Brian Design, titled "How to Make a Quiz App using HTML CSS Javascript - Vanilla Javascript Project for Beginners Tutorial" served as a primary guide for creating this proejct. Brian introduces key concepts and demonstrates how to develop a functional quiz system. Several methodologies and techniques demonstrated in this tutorial were adapted for this project. However, the code written is original and reflects my interpretation of the tutorial's concepts.

If you're interested in the specifics, here are the main topics the video covers that have been adapted for this project:

    - Creating a basic structure for quizzes
    - Designing interactive questions and answer options
    - Implementing a scoring system

Please note that while these resources significantly contributed to the development of the project, the codebase for this project is original and was re-written by myself. The knowledge and methods learned from these resources have been crucial to the project's realization.

Finally, a special thanks to Brian Design for their insightful and easy-to-follow tutorial.
